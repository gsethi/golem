Golem (Go Launch on Every Machine) strives to be the simplest possible system for distributing computational analysis across processes and machines in a Unix/Linux based cluster. It uses web technologies, core features of the Go language and Unix enviroment to keep internal code simple and maintainable. It is being developed at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle, WA to provide a fast, light, simple and accessible tools for parallelizing algorithms used in computational biology, cancer research and large scale data analysis.
